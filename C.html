<h1>C Programming Language Tutorial
</h1>
<p>The C Language is developed by <br> Dennis Ritchie for creating system <br>applications that directly interact with <br>the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, etc.
    C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language.
<br>
    It can be defined by the following ways:<br>
    1.Mother language<br>
    2.System programming languag<br>
    3.  Procedure-oriented programming language<br>
    4. Structured programming language<br>
     5.Mid-level programming language
